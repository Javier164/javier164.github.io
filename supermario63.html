    <br><b>Notice: </b><em>Due to GitHub pages not having an accessible setting for MIME types, Flash games using Ruffle will load slower than usual.<br>
    Adding onto this, this section of the site is minimalistic. This is so that way games can load in quicker.<br>
    <b>Note:</b> This may take about a minute to 90 seconds to load. If this doesn't load after that time, reload and restart.<br>
    <b>Note 2:</b> If you hear overlapping sounds, then restart the game. It is not Ruffle's fault or my fault, it was just the incompetence of preventing that back then.</em>
